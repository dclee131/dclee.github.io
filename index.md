I am pursuing Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, currently advised by Professor Jean-Jacques Slotine. I recieved my M.A.Sc in Electrical Engineering and B.A.Sc in Engineering Science at the University of Toronto. My current research interests are sequential convex restriction and its applications.
