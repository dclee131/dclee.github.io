I am currently pursuing Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My advisor is Professor [Jean-Jacques Slotine](http://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/JJS@MIT.EDU), and I was previously advised by Professor [Konstantin Turitsyn](http://www.mit.edu/~turitsyn/). I recieved my M.A.Sc in Electrical Engineering at University of Toronto with Professor [Deepa Kundur](https://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~dkundur/). My current research interests are data-driven and machine learning techniques for nonlinear dynamical systems such as power grids.
