## [**Convex Restriction**](/_posts/2019-10-07-CVXRS.md)

Convex restriction identifies the convex subset of a general nonconvex feasible set described by nonlinear equality and inequality constraints. Nonlinear optimization problems often rely on convex relaxations, which can be interpreted as convex outer approximations of the feasible set. Convex restrictions address the problem of constructing the inner approximation of the feasible set and is especially useful for establishing robustness of the solution under uncertainties. Check out the [project site](/_posts/2019-10-07-CVXRS.md) for more details.

## **Constrained-Input Constrained-Output**

Constrained-Input Constrined-Output analysis extends the BIBO stability in control to consider operational or safety constraints imposed on the state of the system.
